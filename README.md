# Automating_downloads

This repository was created as a training guide to download large amounts of sea surface temperature (SST) data. The scripts were created using the online help provided by PODAAC (https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/forum/) and CMEMS (https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/). Users are encouraged to see these script as a base and add to the scripts using the online resources. 

The subset_JPL.py script was taken from https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/forum/viewtopic.php?f=85&t=219 and incuded in this repository as it was part of the pratical demostration.
